# Goalsplain
### By ***Keturah Howard, June 2020***
*following along [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/Dp75-DnGFrU) for basic concepts of MobX*
## Description
This is a place to write list out your goals to view in detail all the things your want to accomplish. On the front page, enter some goals. Then, when your ready, click on one and go in depth on the details: why do you want to accomplish that? How is it going to feel? What does it look like? 

By providing yourself a space to get specific about what you want and why, youll be motivating yourself and mentally prepparing to go out there and get it. Details help us to better understand the world and ourselves - lets bring that to your goals. 

*This is a practice application to experiment with MobX and refine React skills*

## Technologies Used
- React
- MobX
- Yarn
- CSS

## Plans for the future
- Authorization (either with Firestore or Node.js/Mongo DB/GraphQL)
- Costomizable colors / layout for goals details page
- Collaborability (web sockets)
- hosted

## Instalation and Set Up
1. On this github repo: click clone and copy the link.
2. In your terminal (aka bash), navigate to the directory you want this application to live, and type ``` git clone https://github.com/KeturahDev/goalsplain.git```
3. Open in your code editor: for VSCode, type ```code goalsplain```
4. To view the application in your browser, cd into the project from your terminal with ```cd goalsplain```, and type ```yarn start```


***INFO BELOW CREATED BY DEFAULT***

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
